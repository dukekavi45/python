## 📊 Project Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict restaurant ratings based on multiple inputs like cuisines, location, average cost, and delivery options. With the help of regression models like **Random Forest**, we train and test the data to forecast accurate rating values and potentially recommend better restaurants.
