## 📊 Project Overview

This project provides two main functionalities:  
1. **Rating Prediction** – Using regression models like **Random Forest**, the system predicts restaurant ratings based on historical data.  
2. **Restaurant Recommendation** – Suggests top restaurants filtered by city, cuisine, and minimum rating.  

Additionally, the system generates **visual insights** such as a pie chart distribution of ratings for better understanding of customer satisfaction trends.
